            <h3>Global Covid cases near 295 million as Omicron spreads</h3>
            <p> The overall number of global coronavirus cases is fast approaching 295 million, with the new Covid-19
                strain Omicron showing a spike in the number of hospitalizations.

                According to Johns Hopkins University (JHU), the total case count mounted to 294,997,968 while the death
                toll from the virus reached 5,456,314 Wednesday morning.

                The US has recorded 57,048,792 cases so far and more than 830,067 people have died from the virus in the
                country, the university data shows.
                As the super-contagious Omicron variant rages across the US, new Covid-19 cases per day have more than
                tripled over the past two weeks, reaching a record-shattering average of 480,000. Schools, hospitals and
                airlines are struggling as infected workers go into isolation, reports AP.

                Meanwhile, hospital admissions averaged 14,800 per day last week, up 63% from the week before, but still
                short of the peak of 16,500 per day a year ago, when the vast majority of the US was unvaccinated.
                Deaths have been stable over the past two weeks at an average of about 1,200 per day, well below the
                all-time high of 3,400 last January.

                Omicron accounted for 95% of new coronavirus infections in the US last week, the Centers for Disease
                Control and Prevention reported Tuesday, in another indication of how astonishingly fast the variant has
                spread since it was first detected in South Africa in late November.

            <h3>Study: Omicron evades immunity better than Delta</h3>
            <p>The Omicron coronavirus variant is better at circumventing vaccinated peoples' immunity than the Delta
                variant, according to a Danish study published last week, helping explain why Omicron is spreading more
                rapidly.

                Since the discovery of the heavily mutated Omicron variant in November, scientists have been racing to
                find out whether it causes less serious disease and why it appears more contagious than the previously
                dominating Delta variant.

                A virus can be more transmissible due to a number of reasons, such as the time it lingers in the air,
                its ability to latch onto cells, or its evasion of the body's immune system.
                Investigating nearly 12,000 Danish households in mid-December, the scientists found that Omicron was 2.7
                to 3.7 times more infectious than the Delta variant among vaccinated Danes.

                The study, conducted by researchers at University of Copenhagen, Statistics Denmark and Statens Serum
                Institut (SSI), suggests the virus is mainly spreading more rapidly because it is better at evading
                immunity obtained from vaccines.

                "Our findings confirm that the rapid spread of the Omicron (variant) primarily can be ascribed to the
                immune evasiveness rather than an inherent increase in the basic transmissibility," the researchers
                said. The study has yet to be peer-reviewed.
                About 78% of Danes have been fully vaccinated, while nearly 48% of those have received a third "boosted"
                shot. More than eight out of ten Danes have received Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine.

                The study also found that booster-vaccinated people are less likely to transmit the virus, regardless of
                the variant, than the unvaccinated.

                While more transmissible, the Omicron variant does seem to induce less serious disease, SSI Technical
                Director Tyra Grove Krause told local media on Monday.

                "While Omicron will still be able to put pressure on our healthcare system, everything indicates that it
                is milder than the Delta variant," she said, adding the risk of being hospitalized with Omicron was half
                of that with Delta.

                That echoes the results of some other studies into Omicron.

                Out of a total of 93 people admitted to hospital due to Covid-19 from Omicron in late December, less
                than five were receiving intensive care, Danish data showed.
